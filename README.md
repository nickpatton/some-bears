# some-bears
Throughout my time as an infrastructure engineer, I've always had a need for a simple webserver/app to use as a sort of regression test when making changes to infrastructure, ingress routing, etc. From that need, the "some-bears" app was born.

## what is this thing?
It's a stupidly simple python/flask app that returns an emedded link to a random gif of a bear.

## how do I run it?
```python app.py```

The app can be accessed locally:
```localhost:5000```
